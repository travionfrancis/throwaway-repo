      Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii or Testudines and are
      characterised by a special bony shell which is developed from their ribs
      and acts as a shield against predators. Turtles date back around 220
      million years making it one of the oldest reptile groups, older than
      lizards, snakes or crocodiles. There are 327 known species of turtle alive
      today and many of them are an endangered species. Read the fact file below
      for more information on this remarkable animal. A group of turtles is
      called a bale. Historically, turtles have been the symbols of patience and
      wisdom. In the Hawaiian the word “honu” means sea turtles and represents
      long life. Turtles have been alive for more than 200 million years. They
      have been alive longer than mammals, birds, crocodiles, snakes and
      lizards. The earliest turtles had teeth and they could not pull their
      heads into their shells, but other than that they were very similar to the
      turtles that are alive today. Some people believe that the turtles’ shell
      is what has allowed them to successfully survive for so long. There are
      many species of turtles. Several species of turtles can live to be over a
      hundred years of age including the American Box Turtle. There was an adult
      Indian Ocean Giant Tortoise that when captured was estimated to be fifty
      years old. It then lived another 152 years in captivity. Age 80 is
      middle-aged for Galapagos tortoises. North America contains a large
      variety of turtle species, but Europe contains only two species of turtle
      and three species of tortoise. Turtles will live in almost any climate
      warm enough to allow them to complete their breeding cycle. Turtles live
      on every continent except Antarctica. While most turtles do not like the
      cold well, the Blanding’s turtle has been observed swimming under the ice
      in the Great Lakes region. Turtles can range in size from the 4 inch Bog
      turtle to the 1,500 pound Leathery Turtles. Kemp’s Ridley is the smallest
      and rarest of all sea turtles and is an endangered species as is the
      leatherback turtle. The Hawksbill turtle has nearly been hunted into
      extinction because of it’s unique and beautiful shell. The shell of the
      turtle is what makes it unique. The top domed part of a turtle’s shell is
      called the carapase and the bottom underlying part is called the plastron.
      The shell of a turtle is made up of 60 different bones all connected
      together. These bony parts of the shell are covered with plates that make
      the shell stronger. The turtle’s shell also has nerve endings in it. If
      you touch the shell, a turtle can feel it. Turtles pull their heads and
      feet into their shells to protect themselves. Some Box turtles can eat so
      much that they no longer will fit into their shell
